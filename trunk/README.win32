Sailcut CAD - Windows notes
---------------------------

To run, Sailcut requires the TrollTech Qt 4.1.0 opensource runtime libraries.
You can download the necessary files from Sailcut's homepage on Sourceforge :

Please make sure that the DLL files reside either in the same directory 
as Sailcut or in "C:\Windows\system32".
