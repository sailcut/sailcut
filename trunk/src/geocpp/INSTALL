GeoCpp is meant to be compiled as part of a program which uses it. 

However, a test program and its associated Makefile have been included to give
you an idea of the available functionalities.  To compile this, on a GNU 
system simply type :

make -f Makefile.test

This will produce an executable called geotest.
